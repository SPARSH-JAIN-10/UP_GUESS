# UP_GUESS
This project aims to create an engaging and entertaining puzzle game for Android devices. The game will feature captivating animations designed to make the gameplay experience more enjoyable. It will also serve as a tool for users to test and develop their IQ by utilizing modern technology.


**PROJECT DESIGN**
Multimedia mobile applications and gaming applications have completely improvised conversational interactions where one can perform uncountable tasks. Playing in your free time kills boredom. UpGuess is an application that does the same job. A fun game with a combination of pictures helps you to enhance your vocabulary and feel learning fun.
One of the principal features is that levels are sorted according to the difficulty and once one level is cleared the user can directly move to the other level. Users can log in to the app and save their progress. A huge database is connected to the game which has a large variety of words and pictures. A set of emojis will presented at each puzzle, which will have a relatable answer that the user will type in. Clicking on an alphabet tile on a keypad will move it to the first empty cell of the solution section. Space where the keypad tile was, should become empty and untappable. Tapping on any cell in the solution section will move it back to its position in the keypad. Once the player has entered the correct answer, the next puzzle in the list will appear.


**PROJECT INFORMATION**
Up-guess is an exciting and educational activity perfect for warm-ups, fillers, and review sessions. This game is not only enjoyable but also excellent for enhancing vocabulary and grammar skills. No matter the topic, a simple guess-the-word game with jumbled letters can be highly effective.

**How to Play:**

Show a Picture: Display an encrypted image.
Jumble the Word: Present the word that describes the picture in a jumbled format.
Guess the Word: Ask students to guess the correct word using the jumbled letters.

This game is a lot of fun and is especially loved by young learners who enjoy showcasing their word-solving skills. Plus, it requires minimal preparationâ€”just a way to display pictures and jumbled words.
